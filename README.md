# Movies-App
In this project, I have used <a href = "https://www.themoviedb.org/">TMDB API</a> to fetch movie data and displayed it using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## The home screen shows popular movies using the tmdb API

## One can search for a movie using the search bar present at the top

## One can also view the description of a movie by hovering over the movie's card
- Have added a transition effect when overview pops over the movie card which is not visible in the given image
